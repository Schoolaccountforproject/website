# Welcome, Explorer!

Well well well... looks like you stumbled upon this **treasure chest**.  
Spoiler alert: this is a very bad website, and you‚Äôll probably be not impressed...  

...but hey, now that I‚Äôve got your attention maybe consider giving this project a vote?  
You never know if the *other project* you‚Äôre looking at is secretly part of a *planned alien cyber-invasion*.

## About This Project
This website is a personal project I built to dive deeper into **web development** using **Flask** + **SQLAlchemy**.  
It‚Äôs a sandbox full of random (but kinda cool) tools and features, including:

- A **Task Manager** (totally better than Google Keep üòâ)  
- A **JSON Formatter & Converter** (to/from YAML, CSV, etc.)  
- An **Extremely Essential Cat Facts Page** üê±  
-  ...and other fun surprises waiting for you to explore!

## üöÄ How to Explore
1. Sign up 
2. Dive in   
3. Have fun   

That‚Äôs it. No secret rituals. No alien mind-control devices (probably).

### For Hack club staff that are verifying that each project is legit:
I need to tell you something important. Man, I've had all of my time coding and never really known anything about github other than commit and push, so as a result I committed sensitive files such as config.py and the database that stores users to the github repo, but it's not this one and I'll explain why there's no commit history on this one. After I discovered I've uploaded sensitive information on github repo and that I will have t make it public for summer of making, I tried my best to delete github repo history for these files but I just won't work, I spent at least an hour on this shi and it just wouldn't work so at the end I decided to clone the original with only the publicable files and no commit history and that's this repo, if you need to verify the commit history and stuff dm me on slack (I hope you have slack since ur a staff) at @yushan and I will give you the original repo with all of the stuff in it. Sorry for the extra step I don't have a choice cuz I'm stupid, thank you for understanding!
